        <h3>best way to save what you love</h3>
        <p>
            cobalt lets you save anything from your favorite websites: video, audio, photos or gifs â€” cobalt can do it all!
        </p>
        <p>
            no ads, trackers, or paywalls, no nonsense. just a convenient web app that works everywhere.

        <h3>leading privacy</h3>
        <p>
            all requests to backend are anonymous and all tunnels are encrypted.
            we have a strict zero log policy and don't track <i>anything at all</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            to avoid caching or storing downloaded files, cobalt processes them on-fly, sending processed pieces directly to client.
            this technology is used when your request needs additional processing, such as when source service stores video & audio in separate files.
        </p>
        <p>
            for even higher level of protection, you can <a href="/settings/privacy#tunnel">ask cobalt to always tunnel everything</a>.
            when enabled, cobalt will proxy everything through itself. no one will know what you download, even your network provider/admin.
            all they'll see is that you're using cobalt.

    <section id="speed">
        <h3>blazing speed</h3>
        <p>
            since we don't rely on any existing downloaders and develop our own from ground up,
            cobalt is extremely efficient and a processing server can run on basically any hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
            main processing instances are hosted on several dedicated servers in several countries,
            to reduce latency and distribute the traffic.
        </p>
        <p>
            we constantly improve our infrastructure along with our long-standing partner,
            <OuterLink href="{partners.royalehosting}">royalehosting.net</OuterLink>!
            you're in good hands, and will get what you need within seconds.

        <h3>on-device processing</h3>
        <p>
            new features, such as <a href="/remux">remuxing</a>, work on-device.
            on-device processing is efficient and never sends anything over the internet.
            it perfectly aligns with our future goal of moving as much processing as possible to client.
