            <h3>general terms</h3>
            <p>
                these terms are applicable only when using the official cobalt instance. in other cases, you may need to contact the hoster for accurate info.

        <h3>saving</h3>
        <p>
            saving functionality simplifies downloading content from the internet and takes zero liability for what the saved content is used for. processing servers work like advanced proxies and don't ever write any content to disk. everything is handled in RAM and permanently purged once the tunnel is done. we have no downloading logs and can't identify anyone.

        <h3>reporting abuse</h3>
        <p>
            we have no way of detecting abusive behavior automatically, as cobalt is 100% anonymous. however, you can report such activities to us and we will do our best to comply manually: <a href="mailto:safety@imput.net">safety@imput.net</a>
